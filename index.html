          <h3>About</h3>
          <h4>Who are you?</h4>
          I’m retailescapeartist, but if you want, you can call me retail. I am
          just a former retail worker, now mute streamer. I was closing up shop
          for the night, and then one of the self checkouts starting glowing. As
          I got closer a sinister face appeared, and stole my voice. Now with my
          trusty TTS pad friend, we adventure forth.
          <h4>How long have you been streaming?</h4>
          <p>
            I’ve been around since 2010/2011 but didn’t start streaming until
            2015. I’m a bit of an oldie on this site.
          </p>
          <h4>What kind of games do you stream?</h4>
          <p>
            I like to play a variety of games. My favorite games are indie
            titles. You can also find me doing a speed run of Deathspank from
            time to time.
          </p>
          <h4>What happened to you?</h4>
          <p>
            The short answer is I had something happen to me, and now it is hard
            for me to form words, but I still like to stream and will continue
            to do so.
          </p>
          <h4>Will you play (insert game title here)?</h4>
          <p>
            I have an insane game backlog on steam and other launchers, so it is
            hard to take any requests.
          </p>
          <h4>Do you play with viewers/multiplayer games?</h4>
          <p>
            I tend not to play a lot of multiplayer games, especially now with
            my speaking difficulties
          </p>
          <h4>Who did the art on your starting, BRB, and ending screens?</h4>
          <p>
            That was me. I used synfig studio in order to animate the starting
            and ending screens. I used the same program to make the BRB screen.
            The art took longer than I'd like to admit...
